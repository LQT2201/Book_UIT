    [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **Java 8 or later**: Required for running Spring Boot backend.
    [Install Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
-   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
    [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Frontend Setup

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LQT2201/bookweb.git](https://github.com/LQT2201/bookweb.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd bookweb/IE303-FE
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Run the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the frontend application on http://localhost:3000.

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot with Gradle)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory where the Spring Boot project is located:

2.  Ensure you have Gradle installed. If not, follow the instructions to install it:

    *(https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)*

3.  Build the backend application using Gradle:

    ```bash
    gradle build
    ```

4.  Run the backend server using Gradle:

    ```bash
    gradle bootRun
    ```

    This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8080.

5.  **Make sure you have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud instance.** Configure the `application.properties` file in `backend/src/main/resources` for database connection details (e.g., MongoDB URI).
